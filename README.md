# PEG.js language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to PEG.js files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate)
from the [PEG.js TextMate bundle](https://github.com/alexstrat/PEGjs.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
